# Airtable Case: B2B Doctor Sales Pipeline

 **Deliverable:** Airtable base link (editor access)

## The Problem

Aneeq partners with doctors who prescribe our products to patients. Our sales team prospects doctors, closes agreements, and maintains relationships to drive prescriptions.

Today it's spreadsheets and WhatsApp. Build something better.

*A doctor who churns may return later. A doctor may partner on multiple product lines.*

## Requirements

| # | Requirement |
|---|-------------|
| 1 | **Sales pipeline** — track doctors from cold prospect to active partner (Kanban view) |
| 2 | **Round-robin assignment** — new leads auto-assign to the rep with fewest active leads. Must use a script. |
| 3 | **Activity logging** — every touchpoint recorded and linked |
| 4 | **Stale lead detection** — flag doctors with no activity in 14+ days |
| 5 | **Auto-log partnership** — when a doctor becomes a partner, create an activity automatically |

## What We'll Evaluate

- Data model design (tables, relationships, field choices)
- Automation logic (does it actually work?)
- Script quality (clean, handles edge cases)
- What you added that we didn't ask for

**No questions. Figure it out.**
